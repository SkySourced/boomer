# boomer
is a bot that follows any user into a Discord call, and plays a sound effect randomly within 20 minutes.

I've been developing it since this one time me and a couple friends played 10 hours of silence accompanied by vine boom with a music bot, a true youtube classic.

## Features
The bot has four commands at the moment.

#### /setstatus
This command turns on or off the main function of the bot, specific to each individual guild. By default it is only available to users with the Administrator permission, but this can be changed with /setavailability.

#### /setavailablility
This command changes whether or not users without the Administrator permission can view and use /setstatus and /setsfx. It is only available to users with the Administrator permission.

#### /setsfx
This command changes the sound effect played in the current guild to one of the list of sound effects currently supported. By default it is only available to users with the Administrator permission, but this can be changed with /setavailability.

#### /repo
This command links to this page, for bug reports and to get information on how to use the bot.

Use this link to add the bot to any server you have the Manage Server permission in. Please be aware the bot is still relatively untested, so bugs are likely and reporting them helps fix them.
